# Workspace & Personalization

## Multi-space Mindset
- Split personal, team, and project flows into distinct workspaces.
- Each workspace stores layout, plugin set, sync policy, and shortcuts.

## Create & Switch
1. Settings → Workspace → New.
2. Pick a template (Blank, Writing, Dev, Design) or duplicate.
3. Switch via Dock sidebar or `⌘ + Shift + ↑/↓`.

## Sync Modes
| Mode | Scenario | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time | Desktop + laptop simultaneously | Conflict resolution by timestamp |
| Smart | Occasional device changes | Syncs when idle or on AC power |
| Offline | Air-gapped environments | Manual backups only |

## Layout & Themes
- Grid-based editor snaps panes into columns or floating layers.
- Themes inherit OS settings; override per workspace for contrast or immersion.

## Migration
- Auto backups at `~/Tuff/workspaces`.
- Export encrypted bundles to share and import.

## Pro Tips
- Focus Mode hides nonessential plugins for deep work.
- Pin workflows to the workspace toolbar to avoid manual triggers.
