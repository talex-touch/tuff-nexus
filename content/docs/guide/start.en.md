# Quick Start

## 1. Install & Requirements
| OS | Requirements | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | macOS 13+, Apple Silicon optimized | In-app update channel or TestFlight dmg |
| Windows | Win11 22621+, WDDM 3.0 | Native installer with auto-update |
| Linux | Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 38+, rolling Arch | AppImage + deb packages with SHA-256 checksum |

> Node.js 22 runtime ships inside every build—no extra tooling needed.

## 2. First Launch
1. Run the installer and allow CoreBox global shortcut.
2. Sign in via Apple ID, GitHub, or email.
3. Approve device trust to pull workspace + plugin inventory.

## 3. Account & Sync
- **Workspace**: starts with “Personal”; create more for teams or experiments.
- **Sync mode**: choose “Instant” or “Low Frequency”; mobile syncs on Wi‑Fi only.
- **Data ownership**: stored locally in LibSQL; cloud only sees encrypted config shards.

## 4. Try It
- `⌘ + E` / `Ctrl + E`: summon CoreBox.
- Drag the Dock icon to switch workspaces.
- Notification widget shows workflow queue + plugin health.

## 5. Troubleshooting
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/Tuff` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Tuff/logs`.
- CoreBox `diagnose` command exports a health report.
- Refer to `../tips/faq.en.md` for common fixes.
