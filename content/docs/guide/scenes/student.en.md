# Scene: Study & Exams

## Persona
- College students, post-grad candidates, self-learners.
- Balance course material, online lectures, reminders, and countdowns.

## Setup
| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Clipbox + OCR | File note screenshots, search instantly |
| Task Capsule | Prioritize coursework and study blocks |
| Pomodoro Widget | Tie focus timers to CoreBox controls |

## Flow
1. Create a “Study” workspace with Immersive theme.
2. Run `note new` in CoreBox to capture quick thoughts; sync is automatic.
3. Build a workflow: Screenshot → OCR → Create task—no duplicate effort.

## Tips
- Pin the daily countdown widget for exam goals.
- Use the `Study Sync` workflow to unpack instructor archives into course folders.
