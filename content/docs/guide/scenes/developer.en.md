# Scene: Engineering & Automation

## Persona
- Backend/frontend engineers, automation builders, indie devs.
- Need terminals, editors, monitors, and docs on one surface.

## Setup
| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Git Watcher | Watch repos and push alerts |
| API Tester | Fire requests directly inside CoreBox |
| Snippet Vault | Store reusable code with smart insert |
| Terminal Capsule | Native shell with plugin hooks |

## Flow
1. Workflow: CI event → Notification → Open log window.
2. Stream script output to widgets through Channel APIs.
3. Sync issue trackers with Task Capsule to mirror status.

## Enhancements
- Enable Code Mode theme + monospace fonts.
- Pin repos to CoreBox; typing the repo name opens it instantly.
- Separate personal vs. work projects into different workspaces.
