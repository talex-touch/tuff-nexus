# Productivity Canvas

## Widget Stack
- Combine timers, tasks, and quick commands into a single board.
- Drag to rearrange; hold `Option` to snap to the grid.

## Templates
| Template | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| Daily Briefing | Today’s tasks, weather, meetings |
| Dev Monitor | API latency, build status, logs |
| Creative Console | Ideas, drafts, publishing plan |

## Sync & Share
- Widget layouts and templates sync with each workspace.
- Export the board JSON to share presets with teammates.

## Third-party Data
- Embed Figma, Notion, or any web panel via Web Widget.
- Pull custom metrics through Channel API hooks.

## Maintenance
- Retire widgets for inactive projects to stay focused.
- Add a “refresh” workflow action to keep data current.
