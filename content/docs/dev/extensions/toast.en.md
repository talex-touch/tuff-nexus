# Toast Extension

## Overview
Toast surfaces plugin updates inside the system notification lane with the same calm tone as the OS.

## API
```ts
ctx.toast.show({
  title: 'Sync Complete',
  message: 'Task Capsule updated 3 tasks',
  action: {
    label: 'View',
    run: () => ctx.corebox.open('task.list')
  },
  duration: 4500
})
```

## Design Notes
- Keep titles between 12–16 characters, body under two lines.
- One action button max.
- Coalesce bursts into summaries instead of spamming.

## Status Types
| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `info` | Default |
| `success` | Positive confirmation |
| `warning` | Gentle nudge |
| `error` | Requires attention |

## Debug
Call `ctx.toast.disable()` during development to silence repeated notifications.
