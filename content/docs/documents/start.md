## Q & A

### Q: My platform is not listed

A: We're doing our best to support as many platforms as possible. Please be patient as we expand our compatibility.

### Q: Some platforms are not available

A: Currently, we officially support Windows. For other platforms, especially Apple systems, we don't have a Developer Account to publish applications. The WearOS and ColorOS platforms are still under development.

### Q: I can't start the program

A: Please check if you've installed the application correctly and granted it the necessary permissions. The application requires read and write access to perform its functions. We recommend running it with administrator privileges to ensure full functionality. Rest assured that all code is open source. You can also build from GitHub to ensure privacy and security.
