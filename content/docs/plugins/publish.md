# Publishing Capabilities (Plugins)

Once you've developed a plugin for the `Tuff`, you can publish it to the Plugin Market so that other users can discover and install it. This guide explains the process of preparing, packaging, and publishing your plugin.

## Preparing Your Plugin for Publication

Before publishing your plugin, ensure it meets the following requirements:

### 1. Complete Manifest

Your plugin must have a complete and valid `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "id": "com.example.my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A brief description of what your plugin does",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/my-plugin.git"
  },
  "keywords": ["utility", "productivity", "example"],
  "engines": {
    "polyglot-toolbox": ">=1.2.0"
  },
  "main": "index.js",
  "permissions": [
    "file-system.read",
    "network.access"
  ],
  "screenshots": [
    {
      "src": "screenshots/main.png",
      "alt": "Main plugin interface"
    },
    {
      "src": "screenshots/settings.png",
      "alt": "Plugin settings"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Plugin Icon

Provide a high-quality icon for your plugin. The icon should be:
- A square image (recommended size: 128x128 pixels)
- In PNG format
- Named `icon.png` and placed in the plugin's root directory

### 3. Documentation

Include comprehensive documentation for your plugin:
- A `README.md` file explaining what the plugin does and how to use it
- A `CHANGELOG.md` file documenting changes in each version
- Screenshots demonstrating the plugin's functionality

### 4. Testing

Thoroughly test your plugin:
- Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Verify that all features work as expected
- Check for any errors or warnings in the console
- Ensure the plugin doesn't conflict with other capabilities

## Packaging Your Plugin

Before publishing, you need to package your plugin into a distributable format.

### Plugin Structure

Ensure your plugin has the following structure:

```
my-plugin/
  manifest.json
  index.js
  icon.png
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md
  LICENSE
  screenshots/
    main.png
    settings.png
  locales/
    en.json
    es.json
  assets/
    styles.css
    script.js
```

### Creating a Plugin Package

To create a plugin package:

1. Ensure all files are in the correct structure
2. Remove any development files or dependencies
3. Create a ZIP archive of the plugin directory

```bash
# Navigate to your plugin directory
cd my-plugin

# Create a ZIP archive
zip -r my-plugin-1.0.0.zip .
```

The resulting ZIP file is your plugin package that can be submitted to the Plugin Market.

## Publishing to the Plugin Market

### Creating a Developer Account

To publish capabilities, you need a developer account on the Plugin Market:

1. Visit the [Plugin Market Developer Portal](https://plugins.polyglot-toolbox.com/developer)
2. Sign up for a developer account using your email
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your developer profile

### Submitting Your Plugin

Once you have a developer account, you can submit your plugin:

1. Log in to the Developer Portal
2. Click "Submit New Plugin"
3. Fill in the plugin details:
   - Plugin name
   - Description
   - Category
   - Tags
4. Upload your plugin package (ZIP file)
5. Upload screenshots and other media
6. Review and submit your plugin for approval

### Plugin Review Process

All submitted capabilities go through a review process to ensure quality and security:

1. **Automated Checks**: The system performs automated checks for:
   - Valid manifest file
   - Proper file structure
   - Malware scanning
   - Code quality analysis

2. **Manual Review**: A team member reviews the plugin for:
   - Functionality
   - User experience
   - Documentation quality
   - Compliance with guidelines

3. **Approval**: Once approved, your plugin will be published to the Plugin Market

The review process typically takes 1-3 business days.

## Updating Your Plugin

### Versioning

Follow semantic versioning for your plugin updates:
- **Major version** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor version** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features
- **Patch version** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes

Update the version number in your `manifest.json` file for each release.

### Publishing Updates

To publish an update:

1. Make your changes and test thoroughly
2. Update the version number in `manifest.json`
3. Update your `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes
4. Create a new ZIP package
5. Log in to the Developer Portal
6. Navigate to your plugin's page
7. Click "Upload New Version"
8. Upload the new package
9. Submit for review

### Communicating Changes

Keep users informed about updates:
- Maintain a detailed `CHANGELOG.md`
- Use the Plugin Market's announcement feature for major updates
- Respond to user feedback and reviews

  test('should initialize correctly', async () => {
    const plugin = new MyPlugin();
    await plugin.init();
    expect(plugin.initialized).toBe(true);
  });

  test('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
    const plugin = new MyPlugin();
    await expect(plugin.loadInvalidData()).rejects.toThrow();
  });
});
```
